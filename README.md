A html5 map application using LeafletJS. Datas are from Mapquest.
Initially the map focused on the Eugene area, when the user clicks (or taps on a mobile device), a open marker will be show at that location. In 'open' state that marker displays the address(the street); otherwise it just looks like a map pin.
